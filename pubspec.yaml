  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a

  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family:
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/-Italic.ttf
